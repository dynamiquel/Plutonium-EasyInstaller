<br/>

## What is Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 Plutonium?
It is a special version of **Call of Duty: Black Ops 2** on PC that just simply makes the game better!

### Features only found in Plutonium
#### Dedicated servers
No more being forced to play on slow peer-to-peer servers. You can also host your own servers.

#### Server browser
Pick exactly which server you want to join.

#### Developer Console
You deserve to be able to customise your preferences as you wish. No more being locked out by menus.

#### Modded multiplayer and zombies servers
By right, every PC gamer should have access to cool and fun mods.

#### Free
Plutonium is 100% free from paid stuff.

#### Doesn't connect to Steam servers
Have you been VAC-banned from the original game? Don't worry, this game doesn't care.

#### Doesn't modify any base-game files
This means you can use the same Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 files for both Plutonium and Steam.

<br/>

## Sounds interesting, how do I play it?
#### Just download and run this [file]().

### I don't have Call of Duty: Black Ops 2
If you do not own **Call of Duty: Black Ops 2** on Steam, don't worry! The installer can do it for you. **(This option is technically piracy, but we're not judging. Pirate at your own risk!)**

### I have Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 but not DLC
The game doesn't require any DLC packs but your experience will be limited.

However, you can do any one of the following steps **(This option is technically piracy, but we're not judging. Pirate at your own risk!)**:
1. Select the **Non-Steam** option to install the entire game along with its DLC.
2. Ask a friend who does own the DLC to send you their DLC files.
3. Download the files found on this [site](https://cabconmodding.com/threads/black-ops-2-map-packs-download.1298/).

##### This is a web installer. An active internet connection is required to install the game. The installer itself does not contain any files.
##### I am not affiliated with the Plutonium project in any way. If you require assistance with Plutonium, go to the [Plutonium forums](https://forum.plutonium.pw/).

## Arguments
If you're a simple guy who doesn't care about more complicated stuff, then you can safely ignore everything past this point.

#### /DisableAutoDetect
Disables the installer from automatically choosing a Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 folder. This is useful if you want multiple installations of Call of Duty: Black Ops 2.

#### /Directory "path"
Steam: Sets the currently installed Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 directory.
Non-Steam: Sets where the new installation of Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 will be installed.

#### /Steam
Automatically chooses the Steam option.

#### /NoSteam
Automatically chooses the Non-Steam option.

#### /NoStartShortcut
Automatically disables the Start Menu shortcut from being created.

#### /NoDesktopShortcut
Automatically disables the Desktop shortcut from being created.

#### /NoReShade
Automatically prevents ReShade from installing.

#### /AutoConfig
Automatically skips past the Plutonium and Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 configuration pages. This should be used in conjunction with the arguments above to automate the installation.

#### /DisableSingleInstance
Allows multiple instances of the app to run at the same time. This shouldn't be necessary but anything can happen, right?
